 A Calendar with uniqe design and aproximatly 1,5years of Battery life 

### Update
The Build is finished and you could build this. I decided not to post instructions on building one as the whole thing needs a redesign first. The esp32 is crashing as there are high voltage fluctuations. The motor driver Circuit seems to be the problem with its missing diodes. After the redesign the whole thing should be cheaper simpler and more stable, as I plan on using cheap geared brushed motors together with hall-efect sensors, also eliminating the need for mechanical end stops.
